This repo is one of the T5 Bootcamp requirements. 


# Eatmarna Application

Eatmarna is a governmental application developed by Ministry of Hajj and Umrah for the service of the guests of Rahman,It’s one of the most popular applications in Saudi Arabia, used to  enable those wishing to perform Umrah and visit to request the issuance of permits to enter the Two Holy Mosques to perform Umrah, visit and prayers according to the capacity approved by the concerned authorities to ensure the provision of a spiritual and safe atmosphere that achieves health precautionary measures and controls And the regulatory system.

# Problem Definition and Goal 

In twitter Account (@MOHU_CSC) we have noticed a considerable variety in the customers’ opinion of the provided services especially when many hashtags occurred in a short duration of time. These hashtags describe the customer's experience with such as #اعتمرنا. 
The goal is to figure out the customers registration problems, take their opinion about the Eatmarna application performance and if the customer services team have high responsiveness or not. In light of the increased demand for those services and the need to keep them of the highest quality for long periods, and come up with some suggestions to Eatmarna team at the end of analytical process.


# Dataset
Connecting to Twitter API, extracting the data we need about Eatmarna, and then save it in a CSV file. The libraries/tools that we will use in this phase: tweepy, pandas, and numpy. 
I will conduct descriptive and predictive analytics on dataset to help reach the goal we have introduced in the Problem Definition and Goal.  
For descriptive-analytic, we will provide a summary of collected data like the mean, variance, standard deviation, etc. I will plan to conduct two suitable models for data such as navïe bayes, Logistic Regression, etc. In addition, we may apply data mining techniques.


# Tools
There are tools that will be used to achieve the goal of this study,  : pandas, matplotlib. pyplot , and seaborn.  The work will be done through Jupyter notebook.
those are the tools I can think of. However, going through the model I will come up with mode approaches.


# TO DO 

- Explore the data and come up with EDA phases then use a model to fit the data.
- NOTE: the used features may be increased or changed and the model as well.
